# interest-rate-derivatives
Trying to implement what I've learned so far in the world of interest rate derivatives.

For now my plan is to implement the following functionality:

- Price swaps from bond yields and vice-versa.
- Price forwards.
- Run a Monte Carlo on forwards for a small set of maturities.
- Bootstrap yield curve.
- Price swaptions.
- Price caplets.
- Price floorets.
